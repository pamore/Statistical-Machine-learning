Implementation of KNN Classifier

Problem Statement-

Evaluate the KNN classifier implemented by you on the famous MNIST data set where each example is a hand written digit.

-Briefly describe how you implement the KNN classifier by giving the pseudocode. The pseudocode must include equations for how the distances are computed and how classification is done for each example in the test phase.

-Plot curves for training and test errors: the training/test error (which is equal to 1.0-accuracy) vs. the value of K. Plot 11 points for the curve, using K = 1, 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79, 89, 99. Plot the error curves for training error and test error in the same figure.
